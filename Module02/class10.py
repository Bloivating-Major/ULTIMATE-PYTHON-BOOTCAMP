# Comparison Operators

# print(a >= b) # True Greater Than Equal To
# print(a <= b) # True Less Than Equal To
# print(a == b) # Equal To

# Some Practice Questions

# print((456 == 456) != (235 == 236))
# #               True       !=          False => True

# print(12 < 10 or 45 == 56 or 69 > 70 or 15 != 13)
# #                                             True
# # True M
# # False V
# # True P
# # True Pranita
# # True => 


# print(True and bool(0))
# True and False => False

#  M = T

# Accept 2 numbers from user
# and print the greater number

# a = int(input("Enter a number A : ")) # 10
# b = int(input("Enter a number B : ")) # 5

# answer = a - b

# print((answer < 0 and f"Greater between {a} & {b} is {b}"))
# print((answer > 0 and f"Greater between {a} & {b} is {a}"))
# print((answer == 0 and "Both are equal"))


# Situation 1
# a = 10
# b = 5
# answer = 5

# Situation 2
# a = 5
# b = 10
# answer = -5

# Situation 3
# a = 10
# b = 10
# answer = 0
